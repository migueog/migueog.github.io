Hello!

<img src="/img/miggy.jpg"/>
I'm Miguel Ocampo-Gooding and I'm a front-end developer. I'm a huge fan of coffee and hockey. The things I'm focusing on right now in my career is learning about creating accessible websites for those with disabilities and working with Angular.js!

I'm going into my final year of IT at York University. When not studying, I freelance on whatever projects come my way. I've worked on projects large and small.

Outside of school and work, I'm the designer and webmaster for CUSEC 2016 and the Web developer for TedXYouthToronto 2016. 

You can reach me at migueog@gmail.com

I'm also over on <a href="https://github.com/migueog">Github</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/migue_og">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/miguel-ocampo-gooding-31222817">Linkedin</a>.
