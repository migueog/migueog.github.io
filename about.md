Hello!
I'm Miguel Ocampo-Gooding and I'm a front-end developer. I like coffee, aussie rules football and hockey. Coding is cool.

I'm going into my final year of IT at York University. When not studying, I freelance on whatever projects come my way. I've worked on projects large and small.

Outside of school and work, I volunteer as 1/2 of the web and Design team for CUSEC 2016.

You can reach me at migueog@gmail.com

I'm also over on Github, Twitter, and Linkedin
