Hello!
I'm Miguel Ocampo-Gooding and I'm a front-end developer. I'm a huge fan of coffee and hockey. Coding is cool.

I'm going into my final year of IT at York University. When not studying, I freelance on whatever projects come my way. I've worked on projects large and small.

Outside of school and work, I'm the designer and webmaster for CUSEC 2016

You can reach me at migueog@gmail.com

I'm also over on <a href="https://github.com/migueog">Github</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/migue_og">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/miguel-ocampo-gooding-31222817">Linkedin</a>.
