   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;CUSEC 2016&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a part of CUSEC for 4 years but I want to focus on the last year that I was
involved with the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 2016, I volunteered as the designer and webmaster. For this year, I wanted
to go for a look that was traditional and clean but also had some funky colors.
I decided to take inspiration from CUSEC 2014 and give it a splash of color that
I thought would give the conference a great look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing the website was a great time. The CUSEC 2014 website had a great layout
that was simple and easy to reproduce. The chairs asked that I didn&amp;#39;t use a
hamburger icon button in the mobile view. &lt;a href=&quot;http://builtbybuffalo.com/&quot;&gt;Built
By Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; has a beautiful website and a great nav that did exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the website here. &lt;a href=&quot;2016.cusec.net&quot;&gt;2016.cusec.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had to design the sponsorship and conference booklets. It was great to see
the conference booklets printed and in the hands of everyone at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2014, I was given my first paid job as a web developer. I
developed the website for the 2015 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Geomatics conference
that was held at York University. I&amp;#39;ve made simple websites before but never for
a global audience. This was also my first experience working with a client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into it with big ideas and I wanted to make it look flashy, cool, and sexy.
After having looked at the previous years websites, I wanted to go in a different
direction. Let&amp;#39;s throw in some color, make it a one pager and have the elements
animated in some shape or form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the project, I learned a lot from my mistakes. The most notable mistakes
was not being able to understand what I did when I look at the code after a few weeks
of inactivity, focusing on cool ideas instead of focusing on delivering the content
in an easy to read way, and making the website mobile friendly. These were all
new concepts to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website was built using Bootstrap and JQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the website here &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uav-g-2015.ca&quot;&gt;uav-g-2015.ca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
