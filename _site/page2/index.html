        Hatch Extension and Pair programming
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2016</span>

    <p>I’ve always been pretty curious with how a chrome extension works. Dallis, my girlfriend, works at a great company called Hatch Canada where they teach kids how to program. She needed to create an extension where you can take a screenshot of a kids project and then create a new tab with a nice layout so the student could print the project out. Dallis eventually came to me for help. It ended up being a great time since we pair programmed through the project and I got learn about chrome extensions.</p>

<p>Let’s walk through our solution. We start off by setting an id which we’ll be using to create a unique tab. We then create 3 event listeners that grabs the 3 things we’ll need from the project page. We’re grabbing the project title, it’s URL, and the canvas.</p>

<p>Initially, Dallis had the extension set up so that it would take a screenshot of the whole browser window and then she would crop out the image. We changed it so that we use toDataURL() on the canvas to get a data URI of the image.</p>

<p>The second JS script grabs the project title, URL, and canvas and then writes it into our html. We set up a port variable that connects to background.js and then we listen for the three messages and we put throw them into our newly created tab.</p>

<p>With the scripting done, I decided to show Dallis how flex boxes and BEM work. It’s pretty easy to read but for those who don’t know how flexboxes work then what this stylesheet is doing is setting up a parent container which defines the direction of how its children will be laid out and then we wrote the children classes for the three sections.</p>

    <p>I’ve been a part of CUSEC for 4 years but I want to focus on the last year that I was
involved with the conference.</p>

<p>For 2016, I volunteered as the designer and webmaster. For this year, I wanted
to go for a look that was traditional and clean but also had some funky colors.
I decided to take inspiration from CUSEC 2014 and give it a splash of color that
I thought would give the conference a great look.</p>

<p>Developing the website was a great time. The CUSEC 2014 website had a great layout
that was simple and easy to reproduce. The chairs asked that I didn’t use a
hamburger icon button in the mobile view. <a href="http://builtbybuffalo.com/">Built
By Buffalo</a> has a beautiful website and a great nav that did exactly what I wanted.
Buffalo’s nav bar had a great responsive touch that reorganized the navbar row depending on the screen size.</p>

<p>Check out the website here. <a href="http://2016.cusec.net">2016.cusec.net</a>.</p>

<p>I also had to design the sponsorship and conference booklets. It was great to see
the conference booklets printed and in the hands of everyone at the conference.</p>

    <span class="post-date">24 Dec 2015</span>

    <p>In the summer of 2014, I was given my first paid job as a web developer. I
developed the website for the 2015 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Geomatics conference
that was held at York University. I’ve made simple websites before but never for
a global audience. This was also my first experience working with a client.</p>

<p>I went into it with big ideas and I wanted to make it look flashy, cool, and sexy.
After having looked at the previous years websites, I wanted to go in a different
direction. Let’s throw in some color, make it a one pager and have the elements
animated in some shape or form.</p>

<p>At the end of the project, I learned a lot from my mistakes. The most notable mistakes
was not being able to understand what I did when I look at the code after a few weeks
of inactivity, focusing on cool ideas instead of focusing on delivering the content
in an easy to read way, and making the website mobile friendly. These were all
new concepts to me.</p>

<p>This website was built using Bootstrap and JQuery.</p>

    <p>Submitago is a RoR project developed for my User Interface class. It wasn’t a requirement
to make a functioning app but I thought it’d be a fun exercise to see how designing a UI
would translate to actually developing the application.</p>

<p>This was my first exposure working with RoR. Submitago was designed to be
a moodle clone that improved the UI of moodle while maintaining its basic
functionality. My team found that moodle was too cluttered and wasn’t an enjoyable
application to use.</p>

<p>Working with RoR was such a nice experience. It’s so easy to set up a new project and
to create databases. Things just make sense and easy to fly through the development
process.</p>

<p>RoR A++ would code again.</p>

        Good Morning Mirror

    <p>This project was my first experience working with Javascript. I decided to create
a smart mirror built with Javascript, Annyang.js, and Bootstrap. It was a fun
experience as it got me exposed to working with Javascript and using libraries
that I haven’t been exposed to. It also had me think about how the user would
experience the mirror. What would they use it for? What would they want to see?
How should they interact with the mirror? This was a problem that I encountered
during my development. Initially, I used a LeapMotion to interact with the mirror.
I thought that a person could wave their hand around the mirror to do certain functions.
As development went on, I found that using the LeapMotion required the user to be
active in order for the mirror to work properly. I switched from LeapMotion to using Annyang.js
so that the user can speak to the mirror to use it.</p>

<h2 id="another-take-on-good-morning">Another Take on Good Morning</h2>

<p>It has been around two years since I’ve worked on this project. I decided to revisit the project and see how I would improve it with what I know now.</p>

<h3 id="no-more-voice-no-more-video">No more Voice. No more Video</h3>

<p>When I was using this project as an art piece in a gallery, I saw that Annyang, the JS library that handles the voice recognition didn’t do a great job in large noisy spaces. With that in mind, I took it out.</p>

<p>The original scope of the project was to create a physical mirror that would display information. I decided to change the direction of the project to use a webcam to mimic the idea of looking into a mirror. I’ve been a daily user of the chrome extension Momentum and I feel that the use of that is an improvement over using a webcam. I took out the video and added a nice photo. The idea behind this project is to get info at a glance, not to see your reflection.</p>

<h3 id="lets-add-in-some-geolocation-and-traffic">Let’s add in some Geolocation and Traffic</h3>

<p>Having made some cuts, I added in using the browsers geolocation and Google Maps traffic data to add information that is pertinent to the user. At the end of the day, that’s what I care about.</p>

<p>Knowing that there’s a lot of traffic in my area is important to know and having Geolocation fed right into the function that requests weather data is great! I can be in Montreal or New York and the weather and traffic data will be up to date to where I am.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it’s about the data and information. Not a morning face mug that only a mother could love.</p>

<h3 id="chrome-extension-i-think-not">Chrome extension? I think not</h3>

<p>When revisiting this project, I thought about turning it into a chrome extension but I ran into a problem.</p>

<p>Content Security Policy is a policy that Google implemented into extensions in order to prevent malicious scripts to be injected. It’s the funny thing about programming that you’ll run into dead ends and not be able to carry out what you wanted to do but in end, you learned a thing.</p>

<h3 id="and-at-the-end-what-did-i-learn">And at the end, what did I learn?</h3>

<p>I was happy to reduce the size of the project and implement better CSS. I focused on the experience of the project and not on my original goals.</p>
