title: Good Morning Mirror
---

This project was my first experience working with Javascript. I decided to create
a smart mirror built with Javascript, Annyang.js, and Bootstrap. It was a fun
experience as it got me exposed to working with Javascript and using libraries
that I haven't been exposed to. It also had me think about how the user would
experience the mirror. What would they use it for? What would they want to see?
How should they interact with the mirror? This was a problem that I encountered
during my development. Initially, I used a LeapMotion to interact with the mirror.
I thought that a person could wave their hand around the mirror to do certain functions.
As development went on, I found that using the LeapMotion required the user to be
active in order for the mirror to work properly. I switched from LeapMotion to using Annyang.js
so that the user can speak to the mirror to use it.
