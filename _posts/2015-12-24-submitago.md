Submitago is a RoR project developed for my User Interface class. It wasn't a requirement
to make a functioning app but I thought it'd be a fun exercise to see how designing a UI
would translate to actually developing the application.

This was my first exposure working with RoR. Submitago was designed to be
a moodle clone that improved the UI of moodle while maintaining its basic
functionality. My team found that moodle was too cluttered and wasn't an enjoyable
application to use.

Working with RoR was such a nice experience. It's so easy to set up a new project and
to create databases. Things just make sense and easy to fly through the development
process.

RoR A++ would code again.
