I've been a part of CUSEC for 4 years but I want to focus on the last year that I was
involved with the conference.

For 2016, I volunteered as the designer and webmaster. For this year, I wanted
to go for a look that was traditional and clean but also had some funky colors.
I decided to take inspiration from CUSEC 2014 and give it a splash of color that
I thought would give the conference a great look.

Developing the website was a great time. The CUSEC 2014 website had a great layout
that was simple and easy to reproduce. The chairs asked that I didn't use a
hamburger icon button in the mobile view. <a href="http://builtbybuffalo.com/">Built
By Buffalo</a> has a beautiful website and a great nav that did exactly what I wanted.

Check out the website here. <a href="2016.cusec.net">2016.cusec.net</a>.

I also had to design the sponsorship and conference booklets. It was great to see
the conference booklets printed and in the hands of everyone at the conference.
