I started volunteering for CUSEC back in 2014 as a head delegate for York University.
As a head delegate, I brought about 15 students to Montreal for CUSEC.

For 2015, I volunteered on the design team and led a team to create posters,
booklets, and the logo. Everything that the sponsors, speakers, and delegates
saw and touched, my team made.

For 2016, I was brought back to volunteer as the web and design team. I performed
the same responsibilities as the year before along with developing the 2016 website.
