title: Max Scheduler
work: UI Design
description: Max Scheduler is a manufacturing planning software used to manage jobs
  for different machines at a factory. I was brought into this project to consult
  on the UI and UX of the web app. I was able to spend quality time with the software
  and through my experience I was able to advise on visual changes to help with the
  flow of the application.
